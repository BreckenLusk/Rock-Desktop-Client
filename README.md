A little over ten years ago, RockYourPhone introduced Rock, an easy-to-use package manager that was faster than any other package manager of its time. Rock lasted for a little over a year before SaurikIT realized that RockYourPhone would take over the industry if they did not acquire it. So that's what they did. Rock was merged with Cydia over the next several weeks before officially being shut down. Although some features were, many of the features that made Rock so great were never added into Cydia. Today, over ten years since Rock was shut down, we, RockYouriPhone, have decided to revive the project. We are planning to release what will be the biggest update to date, Rock 3.
